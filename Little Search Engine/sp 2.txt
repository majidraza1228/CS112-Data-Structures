         A dark screen is lit up by twinkling stars .
                         SON
          Baba?
                         FATHER
          Yes, my son?
                         SON
          Tell me a story .
                         FATHER
          Which one?
                         SON
          The story of home .
         A meteorite drifts into frame , heading towards tiny Earth off
         in the distance.
                         FATHER
          Millions of years ago , a meteorite
          made of vibranium, the strongest
          substance in the universe struck
          the continent of Africa affecting
          the plant life around it.
         The meteorite hits Africa and we see plant life and animals
         affected by vibranium.
                         FATHER (CONT'D)
          And when the time of man came , five
          tribes settled on it and called it
          Wakanda. The tribes lived in
          constant war with each other until
          a warrior shaman received a vision
          from the Panther goddess Bast who
          led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a
          plant that granted him super human
          strength , speed, and instincts.

         A visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands
         from the sand animation, and we see them unite , and then
         break apart as conflict arises . Bashenga rises above the
         conflict and eats the Heart Shaped Herb, proceeding to unite
         the tribes .
                         FATHER (CONT'D)
          The warrior became King and the
          first Black Panther , the protector
          of Wakanda .

                         FATHER (CONT'D)
          Four tribes agreed to live under
          the King's rule , but the Jabari
          tribe isolated themselves in the
          mountains.
         We see the Jabari striding off towards the isolated mountain
         region.
                         FATHER (CONT'D)
          The Wakandans used vibranium to
          develop technology more advanced
          than any other nation , but as
          Wakanda thrived the world around it
          descended further into chaos.
         We see images of war and slavery just outside Wakanda ' s
         secretive border .
                         FATHER (CONT'D)
          To keep vibranium safe , the
          Wakandans vowed to hide in plain
          sight, keeping the truth of their
          power from the outside world.
         We see the protective barrier rise around the Wakandan city ,
         as we pull back on the Earth as it spins, now zooming in on
         another part of the world ..·
                         SON
          And we still hide Baba?
                         FATHER
          Yes .
                         SON

         sound.
                         N'JOBU (CONT'D)
          Hide the straps.
         James quickly moves into action, hiding the guns in the walls
         as N'Jobu peers out a window , then clears the maps from the
         table and unrolls a tapestry on the wall , hiding a bulletin
         board. James cocks a handgun.

          Is it the Feds?

         I/E. CARGOTRUCK CHIBOCK- NIGHT
          ,
         Slipping behind a MILITANT, Nakia picks up the man's RIFLE
         and quickly disassembles it as another MILITANT approaches
         and using the BARRELlike a combat stick, puts him on his
         back , out cold.
         She leaps onto a second militant, easily taking him down and
         striking him in the throat.

         EXT. DIRT CLEARING, CHIBOCK - NIGHT
         The four men don't see Panther coming and executing a BARRAGE
         OF PUNCHESAND KICKS, Panther viciously dispatches them. He
         spots the Young Militant firing at him then SLASHES through a
         car door, and THROWS THE DOORat a Militant behind him-
         taking him out.
                        ON PANTHER
         In a moment of desperation , the Young Militant rushes out ,
         firing at Panther to no effect. Then , as Panther walks
         towards him, Nakia dives out , kicking the young militant's
         gun from his hand and grabs him in a neck-lock.
         Swinging around , Nakia kicks Panther in the chest, stopping
         his momentum. Caught off guard, Panther freezes .
                         NAKIA
          This one is just a boy . .. he got
          kidnapped as well.
         Nakia pulls the wrap from the young militant's face , exposing
         his pre-teen expression. She removes her own hijab as well.
         Panther stares at her- for a beat too long ...
                         T'CHALLA
          Nakia . . . I . . . I wanted to ...

         Behind the militant , an UNSEEN FIGURE creeps out of the bush .
         The figure stands , revealing herself to be OKOYE .
         The militant ' s rifle is SUDDE LY CUT IN HALF by Okoye who
                         N
         finishes him with another swipe of her spear .

          You froze .
         T'Challa removes his helmet , facing Nakia.
                         NAKIA
          Why are you here? Eesh, you ruined
          my mission !

         Nakia looks at T'Challa deeply . Then turns , catching eyes
         with one of the NIGERIAN CAPTIVES as Okoye brings them from
         aro u nd the truck .
                         NAKIA

         ERIK KILLMONGER .
         Killmonger stands dangerously close to the glass containing
         SEVERALWEST AFRICAN ARTIFACTS They range from what looks
          .
         like iron gardening tools to masks and short range weapons.
         Flanking the room are TWOSECURITY GUARDS slight
          , l y unnerved
         by his presence .

         she enters and walks up behind Killmonger as he studies t he
         war masks .

          These items aren't for sale.
                         KILLMONGER
          How do you think your ancestors got
          these? You think they paid a fair
          price? Or did they take it like
          they took everything else .
